					<h2>Jay Papasan</h2> Jay has a different version of the business professional author photo, where he is signaling that while he’s a legitimate businessman, his style is younger and more modern. He is wearing a dark, tasteful suit without a tie, and his top button is undone. The outdoor setting also signals openness.

					<h2>Harshajyoti Das</h2>This is not an example of a bad author photo per se, but rather a very bad decision.
					This first problem is that there are two people in the photo. Unless the book is authored by both of them, this is the first bad decision.
					This picture signals a specific set of topics. If the author were writing books about kayaking, or water sports, or adventure, or anything related to the picture, this might be a good picture.
					Unfortunately, this is an unknown author who writes generic marketing books. What is someone looking for credibility and authority in marketing going to think when they see this picture? That they should trust this author’s skills … because they kayak?.

				<h2>Andrii Sedniev</h2> 
				There are a lot of problems here. Start with the tie; it has poorly matched colors, it’s off center, and it’s clearly cheap. Then look at the shirt. The collar is not even tucked into his jacket. The tailoring of both jacket and shirt are clearly off the rack, and furthermore, the shiny material of both the shirt and jacket signal cheapness.
				His haircut is a slightly grown-out buzz cut, which not only signals youth and inexperience, but also sloppiness. His smile is forced and uncomfortable.
				Everything about this photo says “amateur.” Just by looking at the photos, you can tell that Patrick and Jay are serious, established professionals, and that Andrii is not.

(They’re archived at www.gregstolze.com/fiction_library and you can read them for free. Fair bit of Mythos stuff in there.) Also, one comic book (“A Softer Apocalypse”). He’s tired. Oh so tired.
