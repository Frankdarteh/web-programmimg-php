					<h1>Joanna Penn</h1>
					<img src="image/Jo.png" width="200px" class="img-circle">
					<p class="caption">
						This is a classic author photo. This signals warmth and openness. Joanna has a broad, authentic smile on her face— you can almost see her enthusiasm and joy. By making the photo black and white, and tightly cropped, she focuses you on the things she wants you to know about her–she’s positive, optimistic, and encouraging.

						This makes sense— Joanna writes a lot of BOOKS for authors about writing, publishing and marketing. She is a teacher, and this photo signals both trust and warmth.

					<h1>Eric Ries</h1>
					<img src="image/Eric.png" width="200px" class="img-circle">
					<p>
						Compare this photo the one above; it’s the complete opposite. Physically, Eric and Giff are very similar. But the photos feel totally different, don’t they?

						Look at the signals: Eric has a fashionable hair style, his glasses are contemporary, his smile is authentic (but not toothy and goofy), he’s not slumping or accentuating any negative physical aspects of his appearance. His shirt is stylish without being ostentatious, and perhaps most important, look at the background. It is bottom lit and color shifting, which gives it a modern feel that is reminiscent of technology and the future.

						Eric’s audience is basically the same as Giff’s, but Eric’s photo sends totally different signals. Eric is still appealing to a serious technical audience, but he is not unappealing to a mainstream audience. In fact, this photo displays a very sophisticated understanding of how he is trying to position himself: While a serious technical insider, but not a socially awkward nerd.

					<h1>Michael Lewis</h1>
					<img src="image/mi.png" width="200px" class="img-circle">
					<p>
						This picture could be in the dictionary for “classic high-status author photo.” He is smiling authentically with his eyes and is tilting his head, which signals both warmth and interest. His arms are crossed and his shirt is unbuttoned, which signals casualness and comfort. The style of his shirt is tasteful, and his hair is cut in a modern style— both signal professionalism but also comfort.

						This picture tells a very clear story: this is a person who has done a lot in his life and is very comfortable with himself and his work.

					<h1>Patrick Lencioni</h1>
					<img src="image/Pa.png" width="200px" class="img-circle">
					<p>
						This is a very traditional, business-professional style author photo. Everything about this photo says that this man is an American business executive: solid, stable, trustworthy, and part of the establishment. The suit is tailored, dark, expensive and tasteful. His wedding ring is clearly showing. His hair is graying, combed but not stiff, and though he’s smiling, it’s not in an overly excited or awkward way. He is sitting in front of a whiteboard that he has clearly given a presentation on.

						This makes sense. Patrick’s entire market is traditional corporate America, and this picture speaks directly to them, telling them that even though he has some new ideas, he is still one of them.
